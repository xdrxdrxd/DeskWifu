## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Security & Privacy Notes / ÈáçË¶ÅÂÆâÂÖ®ËàáÈö±ÁßÅË™™Êòé

**Please read these points carefully before using DeskWifu, especially if you plan to use the API-dependent features.**

1.  **API Key Storage and Risk:**
    * To use AI chat (Google Gemini) and web search (Google Custom Search), you need to provide your own API keys.
    * **These API keys will be stored locally in the `pet_data.db` SQLite database file in the application's directory.**
    * While the application itself doesn't transmit your keys elsewhere, anyone with direct access to this `pet_data.db` file on your computer could potentially extract these keys.
    * **Protect this file as you would any sensitive information.**
    * Misuse of your API keys by unauthorized parties could lead to unexpected charges on your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account or API quota exhaustion.
    * **It is highly recommended to set up budget alerts and API usage quotas in your GCP console for the Gemini API and Custom Search API.**

2.  **Data Collection and Privacy:**
    * DeskWifu records and stores various data locally in `pet_data.db` to personalize your experience, including:
        * Chat history (short-term and long-term memory).
        * Your expressed preferences, habits, and other information inferred by the LLM.
        * The pet's emotional history and learned personality traits.
        * Task lists and application settings.
    * **Be mindful of the information you share during chats, as it may be stored.**
    * If privacy is a major concern, you might want to periodically review or clear the `pet_data.db` file (this will reset the pet). Future versions may include in-app data clearing options.

3.  **Web Search Content:**
    * The web search feature uses Google Custom Search. While you can configure safe search in your Custom Search Engine settings, the internet is vast.
    * The application attempts to use search results responsibly, but it's not responsible for the content of external websites or search snippets.
    * You can disable the web search feature entirely in the settings if desired.

4.  **Third-Party Services:**
    * Use of this application involves making calls to third-party services (Google Gemini API, Google Custom Search API). Your use of these services is subject to their respective terms of service and privacy policies.

**By using this application, you acknowledge and accept these risks and responsibilities.**

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration / Ë®≠ÂÆö

1.  **Database:**
    * The `pet_data.db` SQLite database file will be automatically created in the application directory upon first launch if it doesn't exist.

2.  **API Keys (Crucial for Full Functionality):**
    * **Google Gemini API Key:**
        * Open the application, go to "File" -> "Settings".
        * Navigate to the "API & Model" tab.
        * Click "Set/Change Gemini API Key" and enter your key.
        * Select your preferred Gemini model (e.g., `gemini-1.5-flash`).
    * **Google Custom Search API Key & Search Engine ID (CX):**
        * You need to create a Programmable Search Engine in your Google Cloud Console or Programmable Search Engine control panel.
        * **Configure this search engine to "Search the entire web" if you want broad search capabilities.**
        * Obtain your **API Key** for the Custom Search JSON API.
        * Obtain your **Search Engine ID (CX)** from your Programmable Search Engine settings.
        * In DeskWifu's settings ("API & Model" tab), enter these into the "Custom Search API Key" and "Search Engine ID (CX)" fields.

    * In the "API & Model" tab in settings, you can:
        * Enable or disable the overall "Web Search Feature".
        * Enable or disable "Daily Automated News Search".

4.  **Other Settings:**
    * All other parameters (personality, emotions, behavior, etc.) can be adjusted through the "Settings" window in their respective tabs. Click "Apply All Changes" to save.

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage / Â¶Ç‰Ωï‰ΩøÁî®

1.  Launch the application (`python DeskWifu_1.3.0.py`).
2.  The Â∞èÊòü desktop pet window will appear.
3.  **Crucially, configure your API keys via "File" -> "Settings" -> "API & Model" tab for AI chat and web search features to work.**
4.  Customize other parameters as desired in the settings.
5.  Interact with Â∞èÊòü by typing in the chat input field and pressing Enter or clicking "Send".
6.  Observe its emotional responses, memory recall, learned traits, and potential web search actions!

---

## üßë‚Äçüé® Customization / Ëá™Ë®Ç

-   **Images:**
    * Default emotion images (e.g., `happy.png`, `sad.png`, `neutral.png`, `thinking.png`, etc.) should be placed in the same directory as the script or their paths updated in the `EMOTION_IMAGES` dictionary within the script.
    * You can replace these images with your own, keeping the filenames consistent for automatic loading based on emotion.
-   **Database:**
    * Advanced users can inspect the `pet_data.db` file using an SQLite browser, but direct modification is not recommended unless you know what you're doing, as it might corrupt the pet's state.
